## Doctors present
The doctors we currently have are:
| Doctor                        | CSV file        |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Dr Devinder Chauhan           | `devinder_chauhan.csv`     |
| Dr Eric Mayer                 | `ericmayer.csv`   |
| Dr Alex Tan  | `alex_tan.csv` |

This data consists of individual patient visits for each doctor. The data is thus longitudinal.

Additionally, this data has been cleaned so that it only represents patients initiated from 2016 onwards.

Any individual doctor's dataset can be accessed through the path `/home/jupyter/charliemacuject/pharma_reports/data/` + filename.
